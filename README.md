# Image Analysis Methods for Automatic Cell Counting
This repository is dedicated to the AIBI 2019/2020 project. This project's objective is to automate cell counting in microscopy images. Using an dataset with 50 images of groups of cells to be counted for trainning and another 50 for testing.


The project has two main goals/tasks:

- Image Region of Interest (ROI) delineation
